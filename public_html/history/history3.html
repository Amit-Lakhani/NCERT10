        <p><br /><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> (a) Why growth of nationalism in the colonies is linked to an anti-colonial movement.</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(a) The sense of being oppressed under colonialism provided a shared bond that tied many different groups together. </strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;People began discovering their unity in the process of their struggle with colonialism. </strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The movements of freedom struggle were joined by the masses to free themselves from foreign exploitation. </strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Thus, the growth of nationalism in the colonies is linked to anti-colonial movements.</strong></span></p>

        <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">(b) How the First World War helped in the growth of the National Movement in India.</span></strong></p>
        <div><strong>(b)&nbsp;During the First World War, to finance the defence expenditure,&nbsp;customs duties were raised and&nbsp;income tax introduced.&nbsp;</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The forced recruitment in rural areas caused widespread anger. In 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India which resulted in acute shortages of food.</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Also, there was an influenza epidemic.</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The hardships of people did not ended after the war.</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Thus, they united under leaders to find a new way of struggle.</strong></div>

        <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">(c) Why Indians were outraged by the Rowlatt Act.</span></strong></p>
        <div><strong>(c)&nbsp;The Rowlatt Act was hurriedly passed through the Imperial Legislative Council despite the united opposition of the Indian members. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;It gave the government enormous powers to repress political activities and allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two years. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;This was an unjust and oppressive law for Indians. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;Indians were outraged by the Rowlatt Act.</strong></div>

        <p><br /><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> (d) Why Gandhiji decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement.</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong>(d) Gandhiji felt the movement was turning violent in many places such as Chauri Chaura incident. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;He felt that satyagrahis needed to be properly trained before they would be ready for mass struggles. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Thus, Gandhiji decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement.</strong></p>

            <div><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>2.&nbsp;What is meant by the idea Satyagraha?</strong></span><br /> <br /><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Satyagraha was a novel method of mass agitation. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The idea of &lsquo;Satyagraha&rsquo; emphasized the power of truth and the need to search for truth. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;It suggested that if the cause was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was not necessary to fight the oppressor. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;A satyagrahi could win the battle through non-violence without seeking vengeance or being aggressive.</strong></div>

        <div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>(a) On 13th April 1919, the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh incident took place in the enclosed ground of Jallianwala Bagh. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;A large crowd gathered in the&nbsp;Jallianwala Bagh.</strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Some people were present to protest against the British government&rsquo;s repressive measures while others were there to attend the annual Baishakhi Fair.</strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Being from outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial law that had been imposed.</strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Suddenly, a British military officer, General Dyer came, blocked the exit points from the Bagh and opened fire upon the innocent citizens.</strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Hundreds of innocent people including women and children were killed and wounded due to firing by the British soldiers.</strong></div>

        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
            <div><strong>(b) The Simon Commission was constituted by the Tory Government in Britain, under Sir John Simon. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The objective of the Commission was to look into the functioning of the constitutional system in India and suggest some constitutional changes. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;But nationalists in India opposed the Commission because it had not a single Indian member. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Therefore, when the Simon Commission arrived in India in 1928, it was greeted with the slogan &ldquo;Go Back Simon&rdquo;. </strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;All parties, including Congress and the Muslim league, participated in the demonstrations.</strong></div>

            <div><strong>&rarr; The image of Germania was the symbol of German nation whereas the image of Bharat Mata was the symbol of Indian nation.</strong></div>
            <div><br /><strong> &rarr; Both images inspired nationalists who worked very hard to unify their respective countries and to attain a liberal nation.</strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><strong>&rarr; The image of Bharat Mata painted by Abanindranath Tagore is bestowed with learning, food, clothing and some ascetic quality also. </strong></div>

            <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The different social groups that joined the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1921 were the urban middle class comprising lawyers, students, teachers and headmasters, peasants, tribals and workers.</strong></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <strong>&rarr; The middle class joined the movement because the boycott of foreign goods would make the sale of their textiles and handlooms go up.</strong>
        </div>
        <div><br /><strong> &rarr; The peasants took part in the movement because they hoped they would be saved from the oppressive landlords, high taxes taken by the colonial government.</strong></div>
        <div><br /><strong> &rarr; Plantation workers took part in the agitation hoping they would get the right to move freely in and outside the plantations and get land in their own villages.</strong></div>

            <br /> <br /><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> 2.&nbsp;Discuss the Salt March to make clear why it was an effective symbol of resistance against colonialism.</strong></span><br /> 
        </div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite the nation as it was consumed by rich and poor alike. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;He declared that the tax on salt and the government monopoly over its production was the most oppressive face of British rule. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Gandhiji sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;The most stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Irwin was unwilling to negotiate, so Gandhiji started Salt march with 78 volunteers. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;He reached Dandi, violated law and made salt. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;This March developed the feeling of nationalism, people in different parts of the country broke the salt law and manufactured salt and demonstrated in front of government salt factories. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Thus, Salt March&nbsp;was an effective symbol of resistance against colonialism.</strong></div>

        </div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;I participated in protest marches, manufactured salt, and&nbsp;picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops and went to jail. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;I really see these services to the nation as a sacred duty of women. </strong></div>

        <div><br /> <br /><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> 4.&nbsp;Why did political leaders differ sharply over the question of separate electorates?</strong></span><br /> <br /><strong> &rarr;&nbsp;Many dalit leaders were keen on a different political solution to the problems of the community. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;They began organising themselves, demanding a separate electorate that would choose dalit members for legislative councils. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;They believed political empowerment would resolve the problems of their social disabilities. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate electorates for dalits. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;Gandhiji believed that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of their integration into society.</strong></div>
        <div><br /><strong> &rarr;&nbsp;After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement, many Muslim leaders and intellectuals expressed their concern about the status of Muslims as a minority within India. </strong></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;They feared that the culture and identity of minorities would be submerged under the domination of Hindu majority.</strong></div>
