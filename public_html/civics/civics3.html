        <span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><span style="color: red;"> 1. Discuss three factors that determine the outcomes of politics of social divisions.</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        Three factors which determine the outcomes of politics of social divisions:<br />
        &#8594; The people's perception of their identities:&nbsp;When this is singular, the accommodation of other identities becomes difficult.<br />
        &#8594; Representation of a community by political leaders:&nbsp;While representing a community, if politicians raise demands that are constitutional, then it is easier to accommodate those demands.<br />
        &#8594; The government's reaction:&nbsp;If the reasonable demands of a community are suppressed by the government, then it leads to social divisions, which in turn threaten the integrity of the country.</div>

        <span style="color: red;">2.&nbsp;When does a social difference become a social division?</span></div>
    <div>
        <br /></div>
    <div>
        <b>Answer</b></div>
    <div>
        <br /></div>
    A social difference becomes a social division when it overlaps with some other social&nbsp;difference. For example, the Whites were rich and powerful and the Blacks were poor and&nbsp;homeless and discriminated against. When one kind of social difference becomes more&nbsp;important than the other, then it leads to division.<br />
    <div>
        <br /></div>
    <div>
        <span style="color: red;">3.&nbsp;How do social divisions affect politics? Give two examples.</span></div>
    <div>
        <br /></div>
    <div>
        <b>Answer</b></div>
    <div>
        <br /></div>
    In politics, there is competition between political parties. If these political parties use this<br />
    competition in support of some social divisions, it can lead to political divisions. This can lead<br />
    to conflict, violence or even disintegration of a country.<br />
    <div>
        &#8594; One example is of Northern Ireland where religious divisions led to ethno-political&nbsp;conflict. Two major sects of Christianity : 53% Protestants and 44% Catholics dominate&nbsp;the country. The Catholics wanted Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland and the&nbsp;Protestants wanted to remain with UK. This led to years of violence where thousands were&nbsp;killed. Only in 1998, peace returned when the UK government and the Nationalists reached&nbsp;a peace treaty and stopped all violence.<br />
        &#8594; &nbsp;The second example is of Yugoslavia where the political parties refused to accommodate&nbsp;each other. Each ethno-religious group wanted to dominate the other. Result &#8211;&nbsp;disintegration of Yugoslavia into seven independent countries.</div>

    <span style="color: red;">9.&nbsp;Read the following passage from a famous speech by Martin Luther king Jr. in 1963. Which social division is he talking about? What are his aspirations and anxieties? Do you see a relationship between this speech and the incident in Mexico Olympics mentioned in this chapter?</span><br />
    <i><span style="color: red;">"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character. Let freedom ring - when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children - back men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics - will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal'."</span></i><br />
    <i><br /></i><b> Answer</b><br />
    <i><br /></i>There is mention of racial discrimination in the speech of Martine Luther King Jr in USA.&nbsp;He is referring to the segregation policies adopted by the Whites towards the Coloured people. He aspires for a country where there will be security for all; where racial abuse will not occur; and where everyone will be treated as equal irrespective of the colour of their skin. This speech and the incident at the Mexico Olympics are both part of a movement that wanted to highlight the plight of the African-American people.<br />
